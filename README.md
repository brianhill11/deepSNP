# deepSNP


# Plan

- design fetures better reflecting technology
- better training data
- better deep learning method


# Datasets 
## GIB
## WXS/WGS
## Simulated data 

Simulate from chr1 

to calculate number of reads (N)
N=(cov * G)/rl

For chr17, cov=30, rl=200 2x100bp
N=(30 * 83M)/ 200==8M reads to be simulated using this command 


# To try
- Train on simulated apply on real?
